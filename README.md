# WreckMP Reference DLL

WreckMP reference dll is a reference for mods which makes integrating WreckMP sync easier, as the developers don't have to worry about whether the WreckMP.dll is in the assembly.
It is **highly recommended** to use this reference to implement multiplayer features instead of referencing WreckMP.dll directly. 

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/maceeikodev/WreckMP-Docs/wiki) for examples, and the [example mod](https://github.com/maceeikodev/WreckMP-Docs).
